# Kwik-E-Mart Inventory Manager Front-end

We, at Kwik-E-Mart, always keep our system up-to-date with our inventory stock using our proprietary inventory management software.
The front-end is built with React and uses React Router for declarative routing. 

## How to use

Login on the homepage using admin, cashier or staff credentials (given below). The Dashboard shows the statistics of the inventory and the app. Using the sidebar menu, users can view the products, filtered by category. Similarly, one can view the list of the users authorized to use the application. Admins can add or delete users, and products, as well as, increase/decrease item stock. Cashiers can decrease stock whereas Staff can only view.
